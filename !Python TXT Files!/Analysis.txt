As an analyst for the Citi Bike Program, I reviewed rider data for the months of August 2017 to August 2018. In order t aggregat this data, 
I downloaded the CSV files for each month (8/2017 - 8/2018) and then used the Pandas package in Python to merge each of 
the CSV files into one master CSV file. once this was completed, I was able to upload this master CSV file to Tableau to create 
the visuals that complement my below analysis

It is clear that users are generally ones who subscribe to the program, but it cannot be said if riders prefer 
to use our biked only once they have a sibscritption or if those who use it as one-tine customers do so only because
they do not ride frequently enought to justify paying for a subscription. riders are spread out throughly through 
New York and New Jersey, but we do not see much activity/ridership in Brooklyn. RIders clearly prefer to ride in the summer months, 
and prefer the morning and afternoon commute hours during the summer and the winter times. this is just a snapshot for my first 
analysis as a data analyst for the Citi Bike Program. I would recommend looking deeper into the preferences of riders in Broolyn 
so that we can get a better grasp of how to increase ridership in that area. also, I would consider analyzing how to encourage riders 
to to try our service so that we can increase single-ride customer base (as opposed to those that have a subscription)
